# Gesticulate - Android swipe detection made simple

This is a simple utility that makes it easy to detect if a user is swiping a finger across a device's screen (i.e. a fling!). You can detect
up, down, left, and right movements. Furthermore, you can set a distance threshold and a threshold velocity. There are reasonable default
values for both thresholds as well.


## Installation

Clone the repo and run

`ant` 

and that'll build a .jar file you can include in your Android `libs` directory.
